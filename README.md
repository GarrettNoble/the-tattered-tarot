# The Tattered Tarot Project

I was curious about Bootstrap's card deck class, so the tarot deck seemed like a terrific way to explore that.

**1:32 am:** Wow, this project involved **_a lot_** of Googling! Stack Overflow was a huge help in sorting out the layout mess. 

I had fun playing around with the box shadow property for the sweet golden glow effect though. :rofl: 

I may return to this project later and tinker with the code some.
